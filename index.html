        Spongebob was created in 1989 by Stephen Hillenburg. Many ideas for the
        show originated from Stephens education book The Intertidal Zone. The
        book was created for Stephen to teach his students about marine life,
        but he ended up taking ideas from the book, and turning them into
        spongebob. Stephen began developing his ideas into spongebob in 1996,
        and it was released in 1999.
